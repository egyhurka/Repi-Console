# Repi-Console
Description of the Console Application:

The console application is a simple command-line interface that allows the user to perform various operations on the system (in the future). The application supports the following commands:
clear, c: Clears the content of the screen.
ds: Lists all directories in the current path.
fs: Lists all files in the current path.
ss: Lists all files and directories in the current path.
exit, close: Exits the application.
config: Access configuration options. (in progress)

Running and Usage:
When the application starts, a command prompt window appears.
The user can enter the desired command after the -$: prompt.
The application processes the command and executes the corresponding operation.
The clear or c command erases the content on the screen. Meanwhile, the ds, fs, and ss commands display directories, files, and both, along with their respective sizes.
The exit or close command exits the application.
The config command allows access to configuration options, where the user can set various settings.

Notes on the Current Code:

The current code lacks support for command arguments, limiting its functionality. Given the current state of the program, its capabilities are somewhat restricted.
